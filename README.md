# A few observable trends...
In this data Charter schools have a higher average in both Math and Reading. Charter Schools also have a much higher percentage of students passing overall.
Smaller and mid-size schools do not seem significantly different from each other, but both seem to do better on average than larger schools.
Suprisingly, the more dollars per student spent the lower the scores on average.
